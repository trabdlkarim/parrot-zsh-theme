## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system: macOS, Linux, BSD. On Windows: WSL2 is preferred, but cygwin or msys also mostly work.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent is fine but we prefer 5.0.8 and newer). If not pre-installed (run `zsh --version` to confirm), check the following wiki instructions here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- `curl` or `wget` should be installed
- [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Installation

You can install Parrot Oh My Zsh Theme by running one of the following commands in your terminal. Basic installation is done via the command-line with either `curl`, `wget` or another similar tool.

| Method    | Command                                                                                                |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trabdlkarim/parrot-zsh-theme/main/install.sh)"` |
| **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trabdlkarim/parrot-zsh-theme/main/install.sh)"`   |
| **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trabdlkarim/parrot-zsh-theme/main/install.sh)"` |

### Manual Inspection

It's a good idea to inspect the install script from projects you don't yet know. You can do
that by downloading the install script first, looking through it so everything looks normal,
then running it:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trabdlkarim/parrot-zsh-theme/main/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

## Theme Configuration

Once you  find a theme that you'd like to use, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. You'll see an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:

```sh
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

To use the Parrot theme, simply change the value to match the name of the theme. That is:

```sh
ZSH_THEME="parrot" 
```

## Note

By default this theme only displays the name of the current working directory, not the full path to it. If you want to display the whole working directory, then go to the line 74 in the theme file (`parrot.zsh-theme`), and change:

```sh
%{$terminfo[bold]$fg[yellow]%}%c%{$reset_color%}\
```

to

```sh
%{$terminfo[bold]$fg[yellow]%}%~%{$reset_color%}\
```
